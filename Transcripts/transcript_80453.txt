[12.87] Every year, humans change
10 million hectares of land,
[16.67] and not for the better.
[18.46] Right now, there are more than two billion
hectares of degraded land
[22.17] around the world.
[23.59] We need to fix this fast,
and technology can help.
[27.84] Restoration is an enormous,
complex challenge.
[30.51] It cannot be done
by simply planting trees.
[33.52] We need to bring native,
complex ecosystems back to life,
[37.85] and it requires deep ecological expertise.
[40.94] Until now, we have been limited
to poor facsimiles,
[44.49] like vast plantations
of a single kind of tree.
[47.78] But drones change that
by allowing us to gather data
[51.03] and plant the right mix of vegetation
quickly, at enormous scales.
[55.58] And machine-learning analysis
enables us to plan the planting
[59.34] and then monitor our restoration work.
[61.92] For example, in Australia,
[64.22] we're using drone-based planting
and ecology-trained AI
[68.09] to restore thousands of hectares
of land mined for coal.
[73.18] Not just planting trees,
[74.77] but bringing back biodiverse,
complex ecosystems.
[79.40] On a larger scale,
native forests here in Australia
[82.15] have been decimated
by catastrophic bushfires
[85.36] and land-clearing for agriculture.
[87.36] This means diminished food sources
and safe habitats for koalas.
[91.58] A new project would allow us to accelerate
[94.45] the restoration of thousands
of hectares of koala forests
[98.42] over the next few years.
[100.21] With these combined technologies,
[102.21] we're able to scale up restoration
[105.51] from a small island
to an entire continent.
[110.01] We can return forests to land
where a mine used to be,
[114.06] or recreate ecosystems
[115.56] like the one we're hoping to restore
on Lord Howe Island,
[118.73] birthplace of one of the world's
largest insects.
[122.11] This unique island
is plagued by imported species,
[125.15] where we're helping to eradicate
the undesirable plants
[128.32] to allow endemic species to thrive.
[131.78] It's not just billions of trees.
[134.74] It's restoring nature
in all its complexity and beauty.
[139.00] Thank you.
