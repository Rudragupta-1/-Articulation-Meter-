[12.56] My students and I
work on very tiny robots.
[16.21] Now, you can think of these
as robotic versions
[18.43] of something that you're all
very familiar with: an ant.
[22.02] We all know that ants
and other insects at this size scale
[24.78] can do some pretty incredible things.
[27.01] We've all seen a group of ants,
or some version of that,
[30.20] carting off your potato chip
at a picnic, for example.
[34.47] But what are the real challenges
of engineering these ants?
[37.91] Well, first of all, how do we get
the capabilities of an ant
[41.86] in a robot at the same size scale?
[43.91] Well, first we need to figure out
how to make them move
[46.51] when they're so small.
[47.92] We need mechanisms like legs
and efficient motors
[50.22] in order to support that locomotion,
[52.07] and we need the sensors,
power and control
[54.56] in order to pull everything together
in a semi-intelligent ant robot.
[58.52] And finally, to make
these things really functional,
[61.07] we want a lot of them working together
in order to do bigger things.
[65.02] So I'll start with mobility.
[67.71] Insects move around amazingly well.
[70.87] This video is from UC Berkeley.
[72.56] It shows a cockroach moving
over incredibly rough terrain
[75.34] without tipping over,
[77.19] and it's able to do this because its legs
are a combination of rigid materials,
[81.19] which is what we traditionally
use to make robots,
[83.55] and soft materials.
[86.37] Jumping is another really interesting way
to get around when you're very small.
[90.20] So these insects store energy in a spring
and release that really quickly
[94.27] to get the high power they need
to jump out of water, for example.
[98.28] So one of the big
contributions from my lab
[101.40] has been to combine
rigid and soft materials
[104.15] in very, very small mechanisms.
[106.37] So this jumping mechanism
is about four millimeters on a side,
[109.53] so really tiny.
[111.22] The hard material here is silicon,
and the soft material is silicone rubber.
[115.06] And the basic idea is that
we're going to compress this,
[117.95] store energy in the springs,
and then release it to jump.
[120.65] So there's no motors
on board this right now, no power.
[124.04] This is actuated with a method
that we call in my lab
[126.80] "graduate student with tweezers."
(Laughter)
[129.47] So what you'll see in the next video
[131.31] is this guy doing
amazingly well for its jumps.
[134.33] So this is Aaron, the graduate student
in question, with the tweezers,
[137.95] and what you see is this 
four-millimeter-sized mechanism
[140.63] jumping almost 40 centimeters high.
[142.84] That's almost 100 times its own length.
[145.26] And it survives, bounces on the table,
[147.22] it's incredibly robust, and of course
survives quite well until we lose it
[150.74] because it's very tiny.
[153.36] Ultimately, though, we want
to add motors to this too,
[155.97] and we have students in the lab
working on millimeter-sized motors
[159.09] to eventually integrate onto
small, autonomous robots.
[162.69] But in order to look at mobility and
locomotion at this size scale to start,
[166.27] we're cheating and using magnets.
[168.24] So this shows what would eventually
be part of a micro-robot leg,
[171.32] and you can see the silicone rubber joints
[173.33] and there's an embedded magnet
that's being moved around
[175.96] by an external magnetic field.
[178.27] So this leads to the robot
that I showed you earlier.
[181.96] The really interesting thing
that this robot can help us figure out
[185.11] is how insects move at this scale.
[187.12] We have a really good model
for how everything
[189.34] from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.
[191.30] We all move in this 
kind of bouncy way when we run.
[194.23] But when I'm really small, 
the forces between my feet and the ground
[198.51] are going to affect my locomotion
a lot more than my mass,
[201.29] which is what causes that bouncy motion.
[203.64] So this guy doesn't work quite yet,
[205.32] but we do have slightly larger versions
that do run around.
[208.39] So this is about a centimeter cubed,
a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,
[212.28] and we've gotten this to run
about 10 body lengths per second,
[215.18] so 10 centimeters per second.
[216.56] It's pretty quick for a little, small guy,
[218.60] and that's really only limited 
by our test setup.
[220.96] But this gives you some idea
of how it works right now.
[224.03] We can also make 3D-printed versions 
of this that can climb over obstacles,
[227.78] a lot like the cockroach
that you saw earlier.
[231.28] But ultimately we want to add
everything onboard the robot.
[234.17] We want sensing, power, control,
actuation all together,
[237.86] and not everything
needs to be bio-inspired.
[240.76] So this robot's about
the size of a Tic Tac.
[243.90] And in this case, instead of magnets
or muscles to move this around,
[247.85] we use rockets.
[250.27] So this is a micro-fabricated
energetic material,
[252.94] and we can create tiny pixels of this,
[255.54] and we can put one of these pixels
on the belly of this robot,
[259.33] and this robot, then, is going to jump
when it senses an increase in light.
[264.64] So the next video is one of my favorites.
[266.62] So you have this 300-milligram robot
[269.66] jumping about eight
centimeters in the air.
[272.06] It's only four by four
by seven millimeters in size.
[274.97] And you'll see a big flash
at the beginning
[277.13] when the energetic is set off,
[278.62] and the robot tumbling through the air.
[280.53] So there was that big flash,
[282.14] and you can see the robot
jumping up through the air.
[285.34] So there's no tethers on this,
no wires connecting to this.
[288.37] Everything is onboard,
and it jumped in response
[290.86] to the student just flicking on
a desk lamp next to it.
[295.24] So I think you can imagine
all the cool things that we could do
[298.90] with robots that can run and crawl
and jump and roll at this size scale.
[303.60] Imagine the rubble that you get after 
a natural disaster like an earthquake.
[307.39] Imagine these small robots
running through that rubble
[309.95] to look for survivors.
[312.17] Or imagine a lot of small robots
running around a bridge
[315.13] in order to inspect it
and make sure it's safe
[317.29] so you don't get collapses like this,
[319.33] which happened outside of 
Minneapolis in 2007.
[323.23] Or just imagine what you could do
[325.00] if you had robots that could
swim through your blood.
[327.52] Right? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.
[329.85] Or they could operate without having
to cut you open in the first place.
[334.21] Or we could radically change
the way we build things
[336.94] if we have our tiny robots
work the same way that termites do,
[340.34] and they build these incredible
eight-meter-high mounds,
[343.11] effectively well ventilated
apartment buildings for other termites
[347.20] in Africa and Australia.
[349.29] So I think I've given you
some of the possibilities
[351.72] of what we can do with these small robots.
[354.15] And we've made some advances so far,
but there's still a long way to go,
[358.56] and hopefully some of you
can contribute to that destination.
[361.42] Thanks very much.
[363.19] (Applause)
