[12.40] What is love?
[15.65] It's a hard term to define
[17.96] in so far as it has a very wide application.
[21.85] I can love jogging.
[23.62] I can love a book, a movie.
[25.64] I can love escalopes.
[28.52] I can love my wife.
[30.71] (Laughter)
[35.78] But there's a great difference
[38.81] between an escalope and my wife, for instance.
[43.90] That is, if I value the escalope,
[46.91] the escalope, on the other hand, 
it doesn't value me back.
[53.02] Whereas my wife, she calls me
[56.32] the star of her life.
[58.12] (Laughter)
[60.71] Therefore, only another desiring conscience
[62.66] can conceive me as a desirable being.
[65.89] I know this, that's why
[67.47] love can be defined in a more accurate way
[69.82] as the desire of being desired.
[74.13] Hence the eternal problem of love:
[76.92] how to become and remain desirable?
[82.87] The individual used to find
[86.49] an answer to this problem
[88.72] by submitting his life to community rules.
[91.73] You had a specific part to play
[93.83] according to your sex, your age,
[96.05] your social status,
[97.92] and you only had to play your part
[99.95] to be valued and loved by the whole community.
[104.03] Think about the young woman
who must remain chaste before marriage.
[107.79] Think about the youngest son 
who must obey the eldest son,
[112.16] who in turn must obey the patriarch.
[117.86] But a phenomenon
[122.15] started in the 13th century,
[125.51] mainly in the Renaissance, in the West,
[129.51] that caused the biggest identity crisis
[132.89] in the history of humankind.
[135.09] This phenomenon is modernity.
[137.36] We can basically summarize it
through a triple process.
[140.31] First, a process of rationalization
of scientific research,
[146.03] which has accelerated technical progress.
[148.71] Next, a process of political democratization,
[153.18] which has fostered individual rights.
[156.29] And finally, a process of rationalization 
of economic production
[160.85] and of trade liberalization.
[163.74] These three intertwined processes
[166.62] have completely annihilated
[169.03] all the traditional bearings of Western societies,
[173.33] with radical consequences for the individual.
[175.96] Now individuals are free
[178.52] to value or disvalue
[181.92] any attitude, any choice, any object.
[186.13] But as a result, they are themselves confronted
[192.34] with this same freedom that others have
[194.41] to value or disvalue them.
[198.86] In other words, my value was once ensured
[204.20] by submitting myself 
to the traditional authorities.
[208.11] Now it is quoted in the stock exchange.
[213.40] On the free market of individual desires,
[218.05] I negotiate my value every day.
[222.03] Hence the anxiety of contemporary man.
[224.62] He is obsessed: "Am I desirable? How desirable?
[228.71] How many people are going to love me?"
[231.80] And how does he respond to this anxiety?
[234.51] Well, by hysterically collecting
symbols of desirability.
[244.49] (Laughter)
[247.46] I call this act of collecting,
[249.76] along with others, seduction capital.
[253.12] Indeed, our consumer society
[255.16] is largely based on seduction capital.
[260.63] It is said about this consumption
that our age is materialistic.
[264.74] But it's not true! We only accumulate objects
[268.69] in order to communicate with other minds.
[271.50] We do it to make them love us, to seduce them.
[276.92] Nothing could be less materialistic, 
or more sentimental,
[280.64] than a teenager buying brand new jeans
[284.86] and tearing them at the knees,
[287.36] because he wants to please Jennifer.
[289.47] (Laughter)
[291.92] Consumerism is not materialism.
[295.20] It is rather what is swallowed up
[297.28] and sacrificed in the name of the god of love,
[300.29] or rather in the name of seduction capital.
[304.73] In light of this observation on contemporary love,
[310.11] how can we think of love in the years to come?
[313.43] We can envision two hypotheses:
[315.71] The first one consists of betting
[318.45] that this process of narcissistic 
capitalization will intensify.
[324.14] It is hard to say what shape 
this intensification will take,
[328.21] because it largely depends
[329.94] on social and technical innovations,
[332.71] which are by definition difficult to predict.
[337.75] But we can, for instance,
[339.66] imagine a dating website
[343.38] which, a bit like those loyalty points programs,
[347.51] uses seduction capital points
[350.70] that vary according to my age, 
my height/weight ratio,
[354.50] my degree, my salary,
[357.02] or the number of clicks on my profile.
[361.49] We can also imagine
[365.37] a chemical treatment for breakups
[368.75] that weakens the feelings of attachment.
[372.56] By the way, there's a program on MTV already
[376.62] in which seduction teachers
[380.61] treat heartache as a disease.
[384.52] These teachers call themselves "pick-up artists."
[388.23] "Artist" in French is easy, it means "artiste."
[391.47] "Pick-up" is to pick someone up,
[394.18] but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks.
[396.30] So they are artists of picking up chicks.
[400.77] (Laughter)
[402.22] And they call heartache "one-itis."
[407.34] In English, "itis" is a suffix that signifies infection.
[410.89] One-itis can be translated as "an infection from one."
[415.35] It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,
[419.12] falling in love with someone
[422.57] is a waste of time,
[424.40] it's squandering your seduction capital,
[426.31] so it must be eliminated
[428.10] like a disease, like an infection.
[431.83] We can also envision
[435.53] a romantic use of the genome.
[438.55] Everyone would carry it around
[442.20] and present it like a business card
[445.40] to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.
[450.39] (Laughter)
[454.02] Of course, this race for seduction,
[459.18] like every fierce competition,
[461.29] will create huge disparities 
in narcissistic satisfaction,
[466.22] and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.
[470.27] So we can expect that modernity itself,
[473.01] which is the origin of seduction capital,
would be called into question.
[477.55] I'm thinking particularly of the reaction
[480.18] of neo-fascist or religious communes.
[485.11] But such a future doesn't have to be.
[490.75] Another path to thinking about love may be possible.
[496.17] But how?
[498.26] How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?
[502.57] Well, by becoming aware
of my uselessness.
[506.78] (Laughter)
[508.88] Yes,
[509.82] I'm useless.
[512.11] But rest assured:
[513.98] so are you.
[515.44] (Laughter)
[517.59] (Applause)
[521.63] We are all useless.
[526.00] This uselessness is easily demonstrated,
[528.41] because in order to be valued
[532.01] I need another to desire me,
[535.03] which shows that I do not have any value of my own.
[537.32] I don't have any inherent value.
[542.76] We all pretend to have an idol;
[545.49] we all pretend to be an idol for
someone else, but actually
[548.41] we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street
[551.83] who appears totally cool and indifferent,
[554.69] while he has actually anticipated and calculated
[557.84] so that all eyes are on him.
[561.44] I think that becoming aware
[563.01] of this general imposture
[565.22] that concerns all of us
[566.63] would ease our love relationships.
[568.45] It is because I want to be loved
[570.84] from head to toe,
[572.33] justified in my every choice,
[574.31] that the seduction hysteria exists.
[577.08] And therefore I want to seem perfect
[579.37] so that another can love me.
[580.99] I want them to be perfect
[582.52] so that I can be reassured of my value.
[584.68] It leads to couples
[587.07] obsessed with performance
[589.36] who will break up, just like that,
[591.51] at the slightest underachievement.
[594.07] In contrast to this attitude,
[598.19] I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.
[600.93] What is tenderness?
[602.30] To be tender is to accept 
the loved one's weaknesses.
[606.17] It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.
[609.83] (Laughter)
[611.02] That's pretty bad.
[613.09] On the contrary,
[614.42] there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.
[617.19] I refer specifically to a kind of humor
that is unfortunately underused.
[621.24] It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.
[624.12] I refer to self-mockery.
[626.90] For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported
[629.72] by the constraints of tradition,
[631.79] I believe that self-mockery
[633.34] is one of the best means for 
the relationship to endure.
