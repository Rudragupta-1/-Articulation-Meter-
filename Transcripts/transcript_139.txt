[25.00] What I want to talk to you about today is
[28.00] virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.
[37.00] What does this all mean for us?
[39.00] What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.
[44.00] It's going to become super exciting as we transform
[47.00] to this highly immersive and interactive world.
[51.00] With graphics, computing power, low latencies,
[54.00] these types of applications and possibilities
[57.00] are going to stream rich data into your lives.
[62.00] So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,
[67.00] are all about extending our current search metaphor.
[73.00] When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,
[76.00] remembering URLs, saving favorites.
[79.00] As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,
[82.00] the Web matching, the index crawling.
[85.00] But we want to use our brain!
[87.00] We want to navigate, explore, discover information.
[90.00] In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.
[95.00] We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.
[99.00] So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat
[103.00] than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?
[106.00] Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
[110.00] So Virtual Earth is about starting off
[113.00] creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
[118.00] What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
[121.00] Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,
[126.00] global perspective, local knowledge.
[129.00] So when you think about this problem,
[131.00] what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?
[135.00] Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,
[139.00] from ground vehicles, from people.
[142.00] This process is an engineering problem,
[147.00] a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.
[151.00] Here is an example of our aerial camera.
[153.00] This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.
[156.00] In addition, it's multi-spectral.
[158.00] We collect four gigabits per second of data,
[162.00] if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.
[164.00] That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.
[170.00] We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
[174.00] You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,
[177.00] vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.
[183.00] We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale --
[187.00] what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close
[189.00] to establish that what it's like-type experience.
[193.00] I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,
[197.00] kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.
[203.00] So a little unknown secret is --
[205.00] did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
[209.00] The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him.
[213.00] Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
[217.00] (Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.
[222.00] But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job.
[224.00] We think a lot of good can come from this technology.
[227.00] This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes
[231.00] to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.
[234.00] We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,
[239.00] disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.
[243.00] Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.
[248.00] We made it all freely available on the Web, just to --
[250.00] it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.
[254.00] When we think about how all this comes together,
[257.00] it's all about software, algorithms and math.
[261.00] You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models
[264.00] we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.
[269.00] We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.
[271.00] Extract geometry from the images.
[274.00] This process is a very calculated process.
[278.00] In fact, it was always done manual.
[279.00] Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor
[283.00] for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.
[286.00] They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
[288.00] They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.
[292.00] We do this all through software, algorithms and math --
[294.00] a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
[297.00] We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,
[300.00] and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.
[304.00] We think about the user interface.
[306.00] What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
[309.00] An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery
[314.00] while maintaining the fluidity of the model?
[318.00] I'll wrap up by showing you the --
[320.00] this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.
[324.00] What we're doing is -- people like this a lot,
[327.00] this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.
[330.00] But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.
[334.00] A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.
[338.00] So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.
[343.00] You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.
[349.00] I can get the next image. I can blend and transition.
[352.00] By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.
[357.00] The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.
[360.00] I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.
[363.00] What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.
[366.00] We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,
[371.00] and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.
[375.00] I thank you very much for your time.
[377.00] (Applause)
