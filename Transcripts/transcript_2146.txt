[13.51] When I arrived in Kiev,
[15.34] on February 1 this year,
[17.73] Independence Square was under siege,
[20.35] surrounded by police
loyal to the government.
[23.99] The protesters who occupied Maidan,
[26.53] as the square is known,
[28.36] prepared for battle,
[29.98] stockpiling homemade weapons
[32.24] and mass-producing improvised body armor.
[36.16] The Euromaidan protests began peacefully
at the end of 2013,
[41.13] after the president of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych,
[44.36] rejected a far-reaching accord
with the European Union
[47.85] in favor of stronger ties with Russia.
[50.85] In response, tens of thousands
of dissatisfied citizens
[54.20] poured into central Kiev
to demonstrate against this allegiance.
[59.66] As the months passed,
[61.29] confrontations between police
and civilians intensified.
[65.86] I set up a makeshift portrait studio
by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.
[72.25] There, I photographed
the fighters against a black curtain,
[76.55] a curtain that obscured
the highly seductive and visual backdrop
[80.95] of fire, ice and smoke.
[84.86] In order to tell the individual
human stories here,
[88.24] I felt that I needed to remove
the dramatic visuals
[91.38] that had become so familiar and repetitive
within the mainstream media.
[96.45] What I was witnessing
was not only news, but also history.
[100.59] With this realization,
[101.93] I was free from
the photojournalistic conventions
[104.86] of the newspaper and the magazine.
[107.87] Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim
were all ordinary men,
[112.89] with ordinary lives from ordinary towns.
[116.31] But the elaborate costumes
that they had bedecked themselves in
[119.62] were quite extraordinary.
[120.95] I say the word "costume"
[122.74] because these were not clothes
that had been issued
[125.19] or coordinated by anyone.
[127.18] They were improvised uniforms
[129.48] made up of decommissioned
military equipment,
[132.36] irregular combat fatigues
and trophies taken from the police.
[137.72] I became interested in the way they
were choosing to represent themselves,
[142.30] this outward expression of masculinity,
[145.84] the ideal of the warrior.
[148.72] I worked slowly,
using an analog film camera
[152.01] with a manual focusing loop
and a handheld light meter.
[155.76] The process is old-fashioned.
[158.28] It gives me time to speak with each person
[161.27] and to look at them, in silence,
while they look back at me.
[167.75] Rising tensions culminated
in the worst day of violence
[170.98] on February 20,
[172.71] which became known as Bloody Thursday.
[175.66] Snipers, loyal to the government,
[177.72] started firing on the civilians
and protesters on Institutskaya Street.
[183.12] Many were killed
in a very short space of time.
[187.12] The reception of the Hotel Ukraine
became a makeshift morgue.
[191.24] There were lines
of bodies laid in the street.
[194.28] And there was blood
all over the pavements.
[197.91] The following day,
President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.
[202.15] In all, three months of protests
[203.93] resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead
[207.40] and many more missing.
[209.91] History unfolded quickly,
[211.96] but celebration remained
elusive in Maidan.
[215.49] As the days passed
in Kiev's central square,
[218.29] streams of armed fighters
[219.83] were joined by tens of thousands
of ordinary people,
[223.25] filling the streets in an act
of collective mourning.
[227.17] Many were women who often carried flowers
[229.59] that they had brought to lay
as marks of respect for the dead.
[233.77] They came day after day
[235.34] and they covered the square
with millions of flowers.
[240.52] Sadness enveloped Maidan.
[243.28] It was quiet and I could hear
the birds singing.
[245.90] I hadn't heard that before.
[248.14] I stopped women
as they approached the barricades
[250.64] to lay their tributes
[251.81] and asked to make their picture.
[254.48] Most women cried when I photographed them.
[257.59] On the first day,
my fixer, Emine, and I cried
[259.77] with almost every woman
who visited our studio.
[264.88] There had been such a noticeable
absence of women
[267.88] up until that point.
[269.62] And the color of their pastel coats,
[271.92] their shiny handbags,
[273.66] and the bunches of red carnations,
[275.75] white tulips and yellow roses
that they carried
[278.98] jarred with the blackened square
[281.11] and the blackened men
who were encamped there.
[285.11] It is clear to me
that these two sets of pictures
[287.96] don't make much sense without the other.
[290.69] They are about men and women
and the way we are --
[293.09] not the way we look,
but the way we are.
[295.83] They speak about different
gender roles in conflict,
[298.66] not only in Maidan,
and not only in Ukraine.
[302.60] Men fight most wars and women mourn them.
[306.40] If the men showed
the ideal of the warrior,
[308.83] then the women showed
the implications of such violence.
[313.26] When I made these pictures,
[315.02] I believed that I was documenting
the end of violent events in Ukraine.
[318.82] But now I understand
that it is a record of the beginning.
[322.32] Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,
[325.73] while hundreds of thousands
have been displaced.
[329.85] I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.
[332.55] In Maidan, the barricades
have been dismantled,
[336.04] and the paving stones which were used
as weapons during the protests replaced,
[339.92] so that traffic flows freely
through the center of the square.
[344.13] The fighters, the women
and the flowers are gone.
[348.74] A huge billboard depicting geese
flying over a wheat field
[352.54] covers the burned-out shell
of the trade union's building
[355.81] and proclaims,
[357.23] "Glory to Ukraine.
[358.69] Glory to heroes."
[360.38] Thank you.
[361.38] (Applause).
