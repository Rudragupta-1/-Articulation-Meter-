[2.72] when people look at me they see what
[5.12] they want to see and that comes with
[7.84] a lot of expectations
[10.24] i know what it's like to be judged and
[12.72] to be put down
[14.32] i know what it's like to have other
[15.76] people form opinions of you without even
[18.24] knowing you
[19.68] trying to dim your light i want to say
[22.16] you are not defined by an instagram
[25.44] photo by a like by a comment that does
[28.64] not define you
[31.04] i want you guys to know that the trick
[33.04] is is to focus on the love and what i
[36.08] want you guys to do
[37.68] every rude comment you get every person
[40.32] that tries to hurt you
[42.16] personally or through the internet
[44.48] i want you to forgive them just forgive
[47.92] them because they don't even know they
[49.76] have no idea
[51.52] there is so much love in this world and
[54.72] in this stadium do not limit yourself
[57.52] because of what others expect we all
[60.16] deserve more than we think and in the
[62.16] end
[62.88] nobody remembers those those haters the
[65.36] comments nobody remembers them they're
[66.96] just background noise when it's over
[69.84] nothing defines you about what you leave
[71.92] behind and what lives you touch on the
[74.72] way but i'm so grateful for what i have
[77.20] and i am ready for what comes next in my
[79.76] life and if you take just one thing from
[82.00] today let it be this
[84.40] i want you guys to believe in yourselves
[86.96] because i believe in you and you guys
[88.88] need to believe in each other so just do
[91.44] you
[92.24] be true to yourself love yourself have
[94.88] confidence in yourself and everything
[97.36] will be fine i am so excited for what's
[100.16] going to come next for you guys thank
[102.16] you so much
